## research interests

<p><div align="justify">
I primarily work in the field of single fiber dynamics - the study of the details of fiber motion when driven by external means.
 The dynamics of stiff and flexible filaments in flow is relevant for both naturally occurring and industrially relevant phenomena, 
 such as flagellar motion and polymer processing. However, the connection between a fiber’s elastic properties, the external driving forces,
 and its eventual dynamics is not well understood.

<p><div align="justify">
 Through an experimental, colloidal polymer model, as well as Brownian Dynamics simulation, I am probing the motion of semiflexible and flexible
  filaments as they are driven by external fields or flow, with particular emphasis on dynamical conformation changes and topological changes.

## Education
  
<p><div align="justify"> 
I am currently a third year Ph.D candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Rice University, where I work with
 Professor Lisa Biswal, in the Soft Matter Laboratory. Here, I work with colloidal particle chains as a polymer model, as well as Brownian Dynamics simulations.

<p><div align="justify">
 Previously, I attended Princeton University, where I also majored in Chemical and Biological Engineering, with certificates in Materials Science and 
 Engineering Physics. For my senior thesis, I worked with Professor Howard A. Stone, in the Complex Fluids Laboratory. Using hydrodynamic simulations, 
 I investigated the relationship of flow on the topology of flexible filaments.

## teaching

<p><div align="justify">
As I am pursuing academia and teaching as a career, I am often in the classroom as well. I have been the teaching assistant for undergraduate
 fluid mechanics for the past two years, most recently as a Dean’s TA (with greater teaching responsibilities and interactions with students);
 I have also received three teaching awards for my work as a TA for fluid mechanics and undergraduate lab. Even outside the classroom, 
 I am often in a teaching position, as I currently teach two to three hip-hop dance classes each week, as Artistic Director of our university’s Funkonomics Crew.
 Taking these varied experiences into account, I serve as the ChBE Graduate Liaison to the Center for Teaching Excellence, a new initiative wherein 
 we are organizing workshops and other methods for educators across campus to train various classroom skills.
