My name is Steve Kuei, and I'm a New Jersey native who has spent the past three years turning partially Texan,
 while working with Professor Lisa Biswal at Rice University. Previously, I was a student
at Princeton University, in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. 

I live by the phrase, "什麽略懂一些，生活就彩虹一些"; loosely translated, "if you learn a little bit of everything, your life will be that much more colorful."
As such, this site has everything from purely academic pursuits to origami and street dance. 

Thank you for visiting, and I hope at least one of the pages here piqued your interest! Feel free to contact me at [kuei.steve@rice.edu](mailto:kuei.steve@rice.edu)
or to come find me in room C112, in Rice University's Abercrombie Laboratory.
