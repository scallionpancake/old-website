My name is Steve Kuei; I'm a New Jersey native who has spent the past four years pretending to be Texan,
 while working with Professor Lisa Biswal at Rice University. Previously, I was a student
at Princeton University, in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering.

I live by the phrase, "什麽略懂一些，生活就彩虹一些"; loosely translated, "if you learn a little bit of everything, your life will be that much more colorful."
As such, this site has everything from purely academic pursuits to origami and street dance.
